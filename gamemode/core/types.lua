--- A list of framework value types used for validation, conversion, and type safety.
-- Types are represented by constant flags for efficient comparison and expansion.
-- You should **only use the named keys**, never rely on the numeric values directly.
--
-- The table also includes reverse mappings from the internal numeric value back to the type name.
-- Use this system to ensure compatibility if values are ever changed internally.
